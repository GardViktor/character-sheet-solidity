# character-sheet-solidity
A Solidity smart contract for creating and managing RPG/D&amp;D character sheets on-chain.

The ultimate goal is to create a robust D&D character sheet. At this initial stage, I am conducting tests and exploring key Solidity concepts such as constructors, structs, mappings, storage, and state and local variables.
